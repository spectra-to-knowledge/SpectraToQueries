Repository to translate spectra to queries.

## Requirements

Here is what you *minimally* need:

- A file containing spectra grouped by classes to extract class-specific queries (the one of the MIADB is attached as demo).

## Installation

As the package is not (yet) available on CRAN, you will need to install with:

``` r
install.packages(
  "SpectraToQueries",
  repos = c(
    "https://spectra-to-knowledge.r-universe.dev",
    "https://bioc.r-universe.dev",
    "https://cloud.r-project.org"
  )
)
```

## Use

To generate diagnostic ions queries from your spectra:

``` r
SpectraToQueries::spectra_to_queries()
# For the 'grouped' version
# SpectraToQueries::spectra_to_queries(spectra = system.file("extdata", "spectra_grouped.rds", package = "SpectraToQueries"), export = "data/interim/queries-grouped.tsv")
```
