Repository to translate spectra to queries.

## Requirements

Here is what you *minimally* need:

- **A file containing MS/MS spectra with associated skeleton information** (or any other relevant chemical classification) **provided as metadata**.
This structure information, stored in the metadata field "skeleton", allows the generation of queries specific to a given skeleton by extracting repetitive skeleton-specific fragmentation patterns.
The MIADB file is provided as an example.

## Installation

As the package is not (yet) available on CRAN, you will need to install with:

``` r
install.packages(
  "SpectraToQueries",
  repos = c(
    "https://spectra-to-knowledge.r-universe.dev",
    "https://bioc.r-universe.dev",
    "https://cloud.r-project.org"
  )
)
```

## Use

To reproduce the example:

``` r
SpectraToQueries::spectra_to_queries()
```

To reproduce the 'grouped' example:

``` r
SpectraToQueries::spectra_to_queries(
  spectra = system.file(
    "extdata",
    "spectra_grouped.rds",
    package = "SpectraToQueries"
  ),
  export = "data/interim/queries-grouped.tsv"
)
```

To generate diagnostic ions queries from your spectra:

``` r
SpectraToQueries::spectra_to_queries(
  spectra = "yourAwesomeSpectra.mgf",
  export = "path/yourEvenBetterResults.tsv"
)
```

Showing all parameters:

```r
SpectraToQueries::spectra_to_queries(
  spectra = NULL,
  export = "data/interim/queries.tsv",
  beta = 0.5,
  dalton = 0.01,
  decimals = 4L,
  intensity_min = 0L,
  ions_max = 10L,
  n_skel_min = 5L,
  n_spec_min = 3L,
  ppm = 20L,
  senspe_min = 0.1,
  sensitivity_min = 0L,
  specificity_min = 0L,
  zero_val = 0L
)
```
